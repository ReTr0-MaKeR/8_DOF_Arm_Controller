# 8_DOF_Arm_Controller

**Author:** Md. Tanvir Hassan
**Project Version:** 1.0

## Overview

This project focuses on the control of higher degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arms. The primary goal is to design and implement a control system that enables precise and intuitive manipulation of robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom. The project leverages Arduino microcontrollers, servo motors, and potentiometers to achieve this objective.

## Features

- Control two 4-DOF robotic arms independently or in synchronization.
- Utilizes potentiometers to capture real-time sensor feedback for precise control.
- Record and playback arm movements for automation and repetitive tasks.
- Highly customizable codebase for adapting to different robotic arm configurations.
- Designed with modularity and expandability in mind to support future enhancements.

## Repository Contents

- **Arduino Sketches**: Contains the Arduino code for controlling the robotic arms.
- **Documentation**: Includes project documentation, wiring diagrams, and user guides.
- **CAD Files**: Provides CAD files for 3D-printed components if applicable.
- **License**: Specifies the project's open-source licensing details.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Assemble the robotic arms and connect the servo motors and potentiometers to the Arduino boards following the provided wiring diagrams.

2. **Arduino Code**: Upload the Arduino sketches to the respective Arduino boards.

3. **Calibration**: Calibrate the potentiometers to ensure accurate sensor readings.

4. **Control**: Use the potentiometers to control the robotic arms manually or record and playback movements.
